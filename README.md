# Fedora-IceWM
Welcome To Fedora IceWM Its A Alternative Of Fedora LXDE
Fedora IceWM Is A Unofficial Fedora Spin Which Is Lighter Than LXDE

Resource Usage Comparison
Environment	Type	Typical RAM at Idle	Notes
IceWM	Window Manager only	~100–150 MB	Extremely minimal, no desktop utilities bundled.
LXDE	Full Desktop Environment	~200–300 MB	Includes panel, file manager (PCManFM), session manager, and more.

Key Differences
IceWM:

Just a window manager with a taskbar and menu.

Very fast startup and minimal background processes.

You’ll need to add utilities (file manager, terminal, etc.) yourself.

Best suited for ultra-light setups or older hardware.

LXDE:

A complete desktop environment built around Openbox.

Provides a more integrated experience (panel, session management, file manager).

Slightly heavier than IceWM but still among the lightest full DEs.
